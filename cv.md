### About Myself

To be honest, I am the person who as a teenager had a dream of being a developer, but after school I chose to study as an accountant. It was a huge mistake. I still can't forgive myself for that. And this burden does not allow me to finish my training as a programmer. So, RSSchool, this is my fourth attempt. Wish me luck!
