          <p>I am an accountant by education, I have a master's degree. I worked as a 1C
            consultant, and one day, as part of studying a new program, I wanted to
            introduce an operation to calculate taxes from a salary into it. And I was
            greatly delayed by this task, there was a passion to solve it, but since I did
            not have programming skills, I could not implement it. But it made me
            realize that I really like programming. And then I began to be interested in
            programming industries and chose Frontend, because I am a creative
            person and I love the visual component of projects. I quit my job to embark
            on a new path.</p>
